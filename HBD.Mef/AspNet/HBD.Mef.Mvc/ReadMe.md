# HBD.Mef.Mvc
>PM> *Install-Package HBD.Mef.Mvc*

As I'd already shared the Mef libraries for [WPF](http://drunkcoding.net/workspace-wpf-application-introduction/), [WinForms](http://drunkcoding.net/the-workspace-for-windowforms/) and [Console Application](http://drunkcoding.net/the-workspace-for-console-application/). So In this post, I would like to share one more Mef library for .Net MVC. 
This library will help you to develop a Workspace for Mvc allows to host and run the Areas in separate projects.
